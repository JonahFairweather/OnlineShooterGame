This game was created by me using Unreal Engine 5 over the course of the summer of 2022. It was made with references to a Udemy course by Stephen Ulibarri, but I deviated
from the tutorial in many places to make the game feel more my own. The online multiplayer is supported by a plugin which was also created by me. This game uses Steam's
online subsystem for hosting multiplayer matches. At the moment this game is not avaiable for download on any platform.
